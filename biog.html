<div class="career"><h1 id="Career">Career</h1>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Watkins became prominent after his fanbase began posting clips on TikTok of his often-violent behavior during live streams towards games, players, and his camera, which gained popularity and became memes. His outbursts have resulted in bans from the streaming platform Twitch and the video game Valorant.[18] Kotaku described Watkins as "one of the biggest and fastest-rising streamers" on YouTube.[16] A game that had contributed to his growth in popularity was Talking Ben. Watkins' videos on Talking Ben the Dog were credited by Lifehacker for bringing the mobile app newfound popularity, with it becoming the best-selling game on the App Store in April 2022, over a decade after its initial release.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">In April 2021, Watkins's YouTube channel reached 100,000 subscribers. Two months later, his channel reached 1 million subscribers.[17] In December 2021, Watkins took part in a Twitch "e-dating" livestream show hosted by Adin Ross. The exchange between Watkins and another participant, Ash Kash, escalated to what was widely interpreted as a rape threat. Watkins was the first contestant to be eliminated, and shortly after the game had ended, he quickly rejoined the Discord call. He started harassing Kash through offensive remarks. Watkins was then kicked out of the call, with Ross apologizing to Kash for his behavior. Watkins was later banned from Twitch for "sexual coercion or intimidation."[20] Watkins' Twitch account would not be unbanned until October 2023, though he would continue to stream on YouTube and would appear on Twitch sporadically on other content creators' streams.[21]</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">2022–2023: Initial popularity and various controversies
In April 2022, a clip of Watkins playing Valorant on a live stream surfaced. In the clip, he tells a female player: "Get off the fucking game and do your husband's dishes."[17] This resulted in one of the game's producers, Sara Dadafshar, permanently banning Watkins from Valorant and all other Riot Games titles.[21][22] YouTube's global head of gaming creators, Lester Chen, replied to the clip, saying he was "on it."[15] Watkins soon apologized for his behavior, acknowledged that it was "wrong", and claimed that he was receiving racist comments from other players that day.[23]

On July 4, 2022, during American Independence Day, Watkins set off a Pikachu firework inside his bedroom, almost burning it down, which attracted media attention.[24][25] He hit 10 million subscribers on YouTube during this month.[16] Later in July 2022, Watkins received a community guidelines strike as well as a one-week ban on YouTube after livestreaming his character being fellated in a sexual Minecraft mod named "Jenny's Mod" to 96,000 live viewers as well as the options "Blowjob", "Sex", and "Strip" displayed on screen. He selected the "Blowjob" option. Initially, he censored the screen as it was happening, but he kept changing it from censored to uncensored. Eventually, he left the screen uncensored, and his character was seen expressing sexual activity. Watkins later confirmed the strike and purported that he may not return to YouTube, but did.[26][27]

In August 2022, he was swatted while livestreaming on YouTube. Officers handcuffed Watkins, and his cameraman was forced to end the stream.[28] Watkins claimed that he had been placed in jail and that Adin Ross had to bail him out, allowing him to return to streaming on August 11.[29] In September 2022, Watkins played in the Sidemen Charity Match.[30] A clip of him went viral in which he became frustrated at English referee Mark Clattenburg for disallowing his goal to be offside, and in response, Watkins proceeded to whip him with the shirt he removed while celebrating, which resulted in him receiving a yellow card.[</p></div>

In November 2022, Sky Sports announced that they would stop featuring him on their platform after the emergence of past misogynist and derogatory comments made by Watkins. The platform also removed all content featuring Watkins.[33][34] On November 16, he garnered controversy for allegedly doing a 'pump and dump scheme' cryptocurrency scam after he started a livestream promoting The Paradox Metaverse, an action-adventure game awarding players Paradox Coin.[35][36] The next day, he went live to address the controversy and apologized, saying "I do so much stuff for y'all, I made a mistake. I'm not that smart, I'ma be honest, I made a mistake that I wish I never did but I'm not a scammer."[37]

In December 2022, he won the Streamy Award in the "Breakout Streamer" category during the 12th Streamy Awards.[38] That same month, during the round of 16 match between Portugal and Switzerland, Watkins garnered controversy for his behavior toward a Chinese spectator of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was interpreted by many as racist. During a live stream, he approached a man wearing an Argentina jersey to question him. Visibly confused, the man specified that he did not speak English, which prompted Watkins to start repeatedly hurling "Konnichiwa", a Japanese greeting, and start uttering sounds reminiscent of Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. When a clip of the live stream started circulating online, he uploaded an apology video to his Twitter account.[39]</p>

On May 29, 2024, Watkins attended the annual Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake in Gloucestershire, England, during which he suffered a leg injury, which he claimed required hospitalization.[52] In June and July 2024, during the UEFA Euro 2024, Watkins toured Europe, reaching 25 million subscribers on June 2.[53] On July 3, Watkins visited Norway, where he streamed in a souvenir store. While interacting with a large gathering of fans from a second story window, he injured his ankle.
